/**
 * The main() creates tasks or "threads".  See the documentation of scheduler_task class at scheduler_task.hpp
 * for details.  There is a very simple example towards the beginning of this class's declaration.
 *
 * @warning SPI #1 bus usage notes (interfaced to SD & Flash):
 *      - You can read/write files from multiple tasks because it automatically goes through SPI semaphore.
 *      - If you are going to use the SPI Bus in a FreeRTOS task, you need to use the API at L4_IO/fat/spi_sem.h
 *
 * @warning SPI #0 usage notes (Nordic wireless)
 *      - This bus is more tricky to use because if FreeRTOS is not running, the RIT interrupt may use the bus.
 *      - If FreeRTOS is running, then wireless task may use it.
 *        In either case, you should avoid using this bus or interfacing to external components because
 *        there is no semaphore configured for this bus and it should be used exclusively by nordic wireless.
